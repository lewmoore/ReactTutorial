// React createElement API is as simple as the element that you want to create,
// and then an object that has all of the props that you want to have applied.
// the children can be placed as arguments after the props object instead of as a prop itself
// that is more for convenience

// const element = React.createElement(
//   'div', {
//     className: 'container',
//     children: 'Hello world'
//   })

const content = 'Hello World'
const myClassName = 'container'

const element = <div {...props} className='my-class'>Goodbye World</div>
// this is a self closing div which spreads the props constant throughout the div.
// If you use {} in JSX, you can then interpolate any JS code and it will work.
// similar to object spread in JS.

// anything to the right of the props spread will over write anything that the props is giving
// above example overwrites the className with myClass.
// likewise with the children, closing the div and manually adding the children as arguments
// will overwrite the props
